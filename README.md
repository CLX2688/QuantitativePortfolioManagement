This repository focuses on quantitative methods in portfolio management. I'll continue to update it as per my personal interests and available time. 
Presently, the project within it involves portfolio optimization, incorporating transaction cost modeling, inspired by the principles outlined in "Quantitative Portfolio Management" by Edward E. Qian, Ronald H. Hua, and Eric H. Sorensen, as well as insights from the NTU Financial Engineering Masters' program's "Equity Portfolio Management" course.
